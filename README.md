This Python code creates a basic chat room interface using the Tkinter library, where users can enter a chat name, join a chat room, and send messages. The application has two main windows: the initial window where the user inputs their chat name, and the chat room window where the chat takes place.

### Code Description:

1. Main Chat Room Window: 
   - The application starts by displaying a main window where the user is prompted to enter a chat name.
   - A global list, `chat_list`, is defined to store all chat messages sent during the session.
   - The "Enter" button allows users to enter the chat room if a chat name has been provided. If not, a warning message is shown.

2. Chat Room Window:
   - When a user enters a valid name and clicks "Enter," a new chat room window opens.
   - This window has a `Text` widget where all messages are displayed and an `Entry` widget for typing new messages.
   - A "Send" button allows users to send their messages, which are then added to `chat_list` for persistence within the session and displayed in the `Text` area.
   - Each message appears in the format `<username>: <message>`.

3. Message Sending:
   - When a user types a message and clicks "Send," the message is appended to `chat_list` and shown in the chat display area.
   - The input field is cleared after sending to allow the user to type new messages.

This code provides a simple interface for a single-user chat room, enabling message input and display. Each new session starts fresh without saving previous messages, as `chat_list` is only stored in memory for the duration of the program. This setup could be extended to support file-based storage for persistent message history, or a multi-user chat environment with real-time messaging capabilities.
